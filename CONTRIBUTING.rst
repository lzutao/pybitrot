Patches and bug reports
-----------------------

Patches and bug reports are are encouraged, but please try to follow these guidelines:

- Post bug reports and patches to the `pull request`_,
  this keeps things transparent and gives everyone a chance to comment.
- The email subject line should be a specific and concise topic summary.
  Commonly accepted subject line prefixes such as ``[ANN]``, ``[PATCH]``
  and ``[SOLVED]`` are good.

Bug reports
~~~~~~~~~~~

- When reporting problems please illustrate the problem with the smallest
  possible example that replicates the issue (and please test your example
  before posting). This technique will also help to eliminate red herrings
  prior to posting.
- Paste the commands that you executed along with any relevant outputs.
- Include the SHA-1 hash of commit of **pybitrot** and the platform you're
  running it on.
- If you can program please consider writing a patch to fix the problem.

Patches
~~~~~~~

- Keep patches small and atomic (one issue per patch) - no patch bombs.
- If possible test your patch against the current trunk.
- If your patch adds or modifies functionality include a short example that
  illustrates the changes.
- Send patches in ``diff -u`` format, inline inside the mail message is usually
  best; if it is a very long patch then send it as an attachment.
- Include documentation updates if you're up to it; otherwise insert TODO
  comments at relevant places in the documentation.
